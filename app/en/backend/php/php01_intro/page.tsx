                PHP, also known as <strong>PHP Hypertext Preprocessor</strong>, is a server-side scripting
                language specifically designed to generate dynamic HTML pages.

                PHP was initially developed by <strong>Rasmus Lerdorf</strong> in 1994 as PHP/FI.
                It was intended to add simple processing capabilities to HTML pages.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Over time, PHP has become a widely used programming language due to its
                balance of <span className="font-semibold">simplicity</span> and <span className="font-semibold">power</span>.
                It is also open-source, making it free and accessible.

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Companies like <strong>Zend Technologies</strong> have significantly contributed to PHP's development,
                especially through the creation of the <strong>Zend Engine</strong>, PHP's execution engine.

                To let the server know it must interpret PHP code, we enclose the script
                between special tags, similar to JavaScript.

                A PHP file is essentially an HTML file with certain parts processed by the
                PHP interpreter. These parts are enclosed within{" "}
