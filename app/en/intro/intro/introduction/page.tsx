                    Website development, often referred to simply as web development, involves the process of creating,
                    designing, and maintaining websites and web applications that are accessible through a browser. It encompasses
                    a wide range of activities, including coding, web design, and database handling.

                    While the term web development primarily focuses on building the structure and functionality of websites, it is
                    closely tied to web design, which deals with the aesthetic and user-experience aspects. Development typically
                    involves the technical implementation, translating designs into working sites.

                    Web development is the process of constructing the backend and frontend elements of websites or web applications.
                    It involves coding to bring designs and functionalities to life. For instance, all the websites youâ€™ve interacted
                    with were crafted by web developers who ensure that they operate efficiently and provide a seamless experience for
                    users.

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    Developers achieve this by utilizing various programming languages, tools, and frameworks depending on the platform
                    and project requirements.
